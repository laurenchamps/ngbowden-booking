## About the project

I live in a new apartment building which has a communal rooftop garden and barbeque area available for all residents. Up until now, we have used an adhoc method of reserving the space by posting on our Slack channel. The current system doesn't provide an easy way to view bookings, or prevent double bookings as you have to manually scroll back through messages. My project aims to solve this problem by creating an online booking portal for residents to check availability and create a booking, plus edit or delete their existing bookings.
